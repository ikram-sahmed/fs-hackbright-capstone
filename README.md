As someone who just recently got into scents, I wanted to create a website that helps users pick their personal scents. The website helps users pick scents based on seasons!

Tech stack:
 HTML
 CSS
 Javascript
 Node.js
 Express
 Cors
 Axios

Features:
 Users can login when they first visit the page and pick a season to find a scent that suits them. Users can also get the scent notes when they click on each perfume. Finally, if users are indecisive, there's a random scent generator that helps them pick a random scent.
